# data-structures-journey
This is a data structures journey i am taking 


i started with the arrays 

went to linked lists where i did some projects,i.e (check linked list folder) - contains two files. These files shows simple Python implementations of singly linked list traversal and reversal. They demonstrates how to create a linked list, traverse it to print node values, and reverse the list using pointer manipulation. A great starting point for anyone learning basic data structures and how linked lists work in Python.
