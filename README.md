# data-structures-journey
This is a data structures journey i am taking 


i started with the arrays 

went to linked lists where i did some projects,i.e (check linked list folder) - contains two files. These files shows simple Python implementations of singly linked list traversal and reversal. They demonstrates how to create a linked list, traverse it to print node values, and reverse the list using pointer manipulation. A great starting point for anyone learning basic data structures and how linked lists work in Python.


# 🧠 Stack Operations & Balanced Parentheses Checker in Python(check the stack folder)

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates how to use the **stack data structure** to solve real-world problems. The main focus is on implementing `push`, `pop`, and `peek` operations in Python and applying them to check if a string of parentheses (including `()`, `{}`, `[]`) is **balanced**.

---

## 🧪 What It Does

✅ Traverses a string character by character  
✅ Pushes opening brackets onto a stack  
✅ Checks if closing brackets match the top of the stack  
✅ Pops when a valid match is found  
❌ Detects unbalanced or mismatched parentheses  
🎉 Prints whether the expression is balanced or not

---

## 💡 Stack Operations Used

- `stack.append()` → Push  
- `stack.pop()` → Pop  
- `stack[-1]` → Peek (top of the stack)

Did queues today — covered enqueue, dequeue, and even tried out a priority queue with heapq.
Just messing around with data structures and learning how they work in real life.(check the queues folder)
