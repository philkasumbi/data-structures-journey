# data-structures-journey
This is a data structures journey i am taking 


i started with the arrays 

went to linked lists where i did some projects,i.e (check linked list folder) - contains two files. These files shows simple Python implementations of singly linked list traversal and reversal. They demonstrates how to create a linked list, traverse it to print node values, and reverse the list using pointer manipulation. A great starting point for anyone learning basic data structures and how linked lists work in Python.


# 🧠 Stack Operations & Balanced Parentheses Checker in Python(check the stack folder)

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates how to use the **stack data structure** to solve real-world problems. The main focus is on implementing `push`, `pop`, and `peek` operations in Python and applying them to check if a string of parentheses (including `()`, `{}`, `[]`) is **balanced**.

---

## 🧪 What It Does

✅ Traverses a string character by character  
✅ Pushes opening brackets onto a stack  
✅ Checks if closing brackets match the top of the stack  
✅ Pops when a valid match is found  
❌ Detects unbalanced or mismatched parentheses  
🎉 Prints whether the expression is balanced or not

---

## 💡 Stack Operations Used

- `stack.append()` → Push  
- `stack.pop()` → Pop  
- `stack[-1]` → Peek (top of the stack)

Did queues today — covered enqueue, dequeue, and even tried out a priority queue with heapq.
Just messing around with data structures and learning how they work in real life.(check the queues folder)

(check folder generating binary using queue)This project generates binary numbers using a queue to build sequences step-by-step.
It showcases enqueue and dequeue operations with practical application.
Perfect for learning queue usage and binary number generation.
