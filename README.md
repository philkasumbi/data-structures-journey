# data-structures-journey
This is a data structures journey i am taking 


i started with the arrays 

went to linked lists where i did some projects,i.e (check linked list folder) - contains two files. These files shows simple Python implementations of singly linked list traversal and reversal. They demonstrates how to create a linked list, traverse it to print node values, and reverse the list using pointer manipulation. A great starting point for anyone learning basic data structures and how linked lists work in Python.


# Stack Operations & Balanced Parentheses Checker in Python(check the stack folder)

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates how to use the **stack data structure** to solve real-world problems. The main focus is on implementing `push`, `pop`, and `peek` operations in Python and applying them to check if a string of parentheses (including `()`, `{}`, `[]`) is **balanced**.
## What It Does
✅ Traverses a string character by character  
✅ Pushes opening brackets onto a stack  
✅ Checks if closing brackets match the top of the stack  
✅ Pops when a valid match is found  
❌ Detects unbalanced or mismatched parentheses  
🎉 Prints whether the expression is balanced or not
## 💡 Stack Operations Used
- `stack.append()` → Push  
- `stack.pop()` → Pop  
- `stack[-1]` → Peek (top of the stack)

Did queues today — covered enqueue, dequeue, and even tried out a priority queue with heapq.
Just messing around with data structures and learning how they work in real life.(check the queues folder)



(check folder generating binary using queue)This project generates binary numbers using a queue to build sequences step-by-step.
It showcases enqueue and dequeue operations with practical application.
Perfect for learning queue usage and binary number generation.


did BST validation with boundary checking (check validating a BST folder)
Implements a recursive function to validate a Binary Search Tree by ensuring each node’s value falls within allowed min and max boundaries.  
Includes examples of a valid and an invalid BST.


🔁 Duplicate Finder in Python -(check hash tables folder)
A simple Python script to find and count duplicate numbers in a list using a hash table (dictionary).
## 🧠 How It Works
- Loops through an array.
- Counts frequency of each number.
- Prints numbers that appear more than once.




 🔺 Heap Sort in Python -(check heap sort folder)
A simple Python implementation of Heap Sort using a max heap.
## ⚙️ How It Works
- Builds a max heap from the input array.
- Repeatedly swaps the root (maximum element) with the last element.
- Reduces the heap size and re-heapifies to maintain the heap structure.



🔄 Bubble Sort in Python - (check the bubble_sort.py)
A simple Python implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm.
## 🧠 How It Works
- Repeatedly steps through the list.
- Compares adjacent elements.
- Swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- Continues until the list is fully sorted.



# Merge Sort in Python(check the merge sort folder)
A simple implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm using recursion and list merging.


# Selection Sort in Python(check selection sort folder)
A basic implementation of the Selection Sort algorithm.
## How it works
The algorithm finds the smallest element in the unsorted part of the list and swaps it with the current position. It repeats this until the list is sorted.


# Insertion Sort in Python(check insertion sort folder)
A simple Python implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm.
## How it works
The algorithm goes through the list, takes one element at a time, and inserts it into its correct position in the sorted part of the list.


# Quick Sort in Python(check the quick sort folder)
This project contains a simple and clean implementation of the Quick Sort algorithm in Python.
## Features
- Recursive approach
- Uses pivot to partition and sort
